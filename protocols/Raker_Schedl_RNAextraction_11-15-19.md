## Prada Lab RNA Extractions
### Performed by: Cassie Raker and Maggie Schedl
### Samples: *Orbicella faveolata* fragments from the first round of coral microbiome research in La Parguera, Puerto Rico
1. 2BY9
2. 6BY20

### Date: November 15, 2019

## Kit: Zymo *Quick*-RNA Miniprep Plus Test Kit
Protocol adapted from the Zymo *Quick*-RNA Miniprep Plus Test Kit and the Zymo *Quick*-RNA Miniprep Plus Kit

#### Lab Bench Prep
1. Wipe down workspace and equipment with bleach
2. Wipe down workspace and equipment with water
3. Wipe down workspace and equipment with RNase-free
4. Wipe down workspace and equipment with isopropyl alcohol

#### Reagent Prep
1. RNA wash buffer already prepped
2. add 55 ul DNA/RNase-free water to reconstitute the lyophilized DNase I
3. Flick, invert to mix, then spin down

#### Sample Preparation
Whole tissue fragments preserved in RNAlater and stored in the -80 freezer

1. Remove samples from freezer, let thaw
2. Fill two tubes with RNase-free water (these are just for rinsing)
3. Prepare two other tubes for sample homogenization
4. Add 500 ul of DNA/RNA shield: should be enough to fully submerge tissue samples (we started with 300 ul, then added another 200 ul)
5. Add 50 ul of PK buffer (10% of DNA/RNA shield volume)
6. Add 25 ul of Proteinase K (5% of DNA/RNA shield volume)
7. Vortex samples and spin down
8. Incubate in the thermocycler at 55C and 800 rpm for 5 hours

#### RNA Purification
1. Transfer 600 ul of lysed samples into Spin-Away filter (yellow)
2. Centrifuge for 30 seconds at 16000 rcf: this removes the majority of gDNA
3. Save the flow-through!
4. Add 600 ul of ethanol to flow-through and mix well (1:1 ratio with sample)
5. Transfer mixture to Zymo-Spin IIICG Column (green)
6. Centrifuge for 30 seconds at 16000 rcf and discard the flow-through
7. Begin warming DNase-free Water to 70C

#### DNase I Treatment
1. Add 400 ul of RNA Wash Buffer to column
2. Centrifuge for 30 seconds at 16000 rcf and discard the flow-through
3. In a new tube, add: 75 ul of DNA Digestion Buffer per sample (150 ul total), 5 ul DNase I per sample (10 ul total), then mix by inverting and spin down
4. Add 80 ul of mixture to each sample
5. Incubate at room temperature for 15 minutes

#### RNA Purification, Cont.
8. Add 400 ul of RNA Prep Buffer
9. Centrifuge for 30 seconds at 16000 rcf and discard the flow-through
10. Add 700 ul of RNA Wash Buffer
11. Centrifuge for 30 seconds at 16000 rcf and discard the flow-through
12. Add 400 ul of RNA Wash Buffer
13. Centrifuge for 2 minutes at 16000 rcf and discard the flow-through
14. Transfer columns into new tubes
15. Add 50 ul DNase/RNase-Free Water directly to column matrix
16. Centrifuge for 30 seconds at 16000 rcf and discard the flow-through
17. Add 50 ul DNase/RNase-Free Water directly to column matrix
18. Centrifuge for 30 seconds at 16000 rcf and discard the flow-through
19. Aliquot out 5 ul for quantification (tape station and Qubit) and store in -80 for future use
20. Store the rest of the eluted RNA in the -80
21. Clean up!

#### Notes
1. All tubes used should be RNase-free
2. Tubes used throughout the procedure do not require full labels, but final sample tubes should include sample ID, initials, and date
