1. 2BY9
2. 6BY20

### Date: November 15, 2019

## Kit: Zymo *Quick*-RNA Miniprep Plus Test Kit
Protocol adapted from the Zymo *Quick*-RNA Miniprep Plus Test Kit and the Zymo *Quick*-RNA Miniprep Plus Kit

#### RNA Lab Bench Prep
1. Wipe down workspace  with 10% bleach
2. Wipe down workspace  with Type II DI water
3. Wipe down workspace with 70% Ethanol
4. Wipe down workspace and equipment with RNase Zap: lab bench, tube racks being used, pipettes, vortexers, outside of centrifuges, outside of thermomixers

#### Reagent Prep
1. RNA wash buffer already prepped
2. add 55 ul DNA/RNase-free water to reconstitute the lyophilized DNase I
3. Flick, invert to mix, then spin down

#### Sample Preparation
Whole tissue fragments preserved in RNAlater and stored in the -80 freezer

1. Remove samples from freezer, let thaw
2. Fill two 1.5mL nuclease-free tubes with RNase-free water (these are just for rinsing)
3. Prepare an two other 1.5mL nuclease-free tubes for sample homogenization
4. Add 500 ul of DNA/RNA shield to the empty 1.5mL tubes: should be enough to fully submerge tissue samples (we started with 300 ul, then added another 200 ul)
5. Clean forceps with 10% bleach, DI water, and RNase zap
6. Using forceps, removed coral piece(s) from tube, dunked lightly in RNase-free water tube, and placed in tube with DNA/RNA Shield
7. Repeated steps 5 and 6 for other coral sample(s)
8. Add 50 ul of PK buffer (10% of DNA/RNA shield volume)
9. Add 25 ul of Proteinase K (5% of DNA/RNA shield volume)
10. Vortex samples and spin down
11. Incubate in the thermomixer at 55C and 800 rpm for 5 hours

#### RNA Purification
1. Vortexed samples (about 30 seconds) from thermomixer and centrifuged at maximum speed for 2 minutes
2. Transferred 300ul of supernatant to new 1.5mL tubes
3. Added equal volume (300ul) of RNA Lysis Buffer to each sample, vortexed, and spun down
1. Transfer 600 ul of samples into Spin-Away filter (yellow) column with collection tube
2. Centrifuge for 30 seconds at 16000 rcf: this removes the majority of gDNA
3. Transfer and save the flow-through in new 1.5mL tubes. The column can be discarded
4. Add 600 ul of 100% ethanol to each flow-through tube and mix well (1:1 ratio with sample)
5. Transfer 600ul of flow-through and ethanol mix to Zymo-Spin IIICG Column (green)
6. Centrifuge for 30 seconds at 16000 rcf and discard the flow-through in Zymo DNA/RNA kit liquid waste
7. Transfer remaining volume of sample (flow-through and ethanol mix) to the appropriate Zymo-Spin IIICG Column (green)
8.  Centrifuge for 30 seconds at 16000 rcf and discard the flow-through in Zymo DNA/RNA kit liquid waste
7. Begin warming DNase-free Water (in a 1.5mL tube) to 70C in a thermomixer

#### DNase I Treatment
1. Add 400 ul of RNA Wash Buffer to column
2. Centrifuge for 30 seconds at 16000 rcf and discard the flow-through in Zymo DNA/RNA kit liquid waste
3. In a new tube, add: 75 ul of DNA Digestion Buffer per sample (150 ul total), 5 ul DNase I per sample (10 ul total), then mix by inverting and spin down
4. Add 80 ul of mixture to each Zymo-Spin IIICG Column (green), dripping directly onto the column
5. Incubate at room temperature for 15 minutes

#### RNA Purification, Cont.
13. Add 400 ul of RNA Prep Buffer to each column
9. Centrifuge for 30 seconds at 16000 rcf and discard the flow-through in Zymo DNA/RNA kit liquid waste
10. Add 700 ul of RNA Wash Buffer to each column
11. Centrifuge for 30 seconds at 16000 rcf and discard the flow-through in Zymo DNA/RNA kit liquid waste
12. Add 400 ul of RNA Wash Buffer to each column
13. Centrifuge for 2 minutes at 16000 rcf and discard the flow-through in Zymo DNA/RNA kit liquid waste
14. Transfer columns into new 1.5mL nuclease-free tubes. Label these final sample tubes with the original sample number, RNA, the date, and your initials
15. Add 50 ul if warmed DNase/RNase-Free Water directly to column matrix and place back in thermomixer to keep warm
16. Incubate columns at room temp for 5 minutes
16. Centrifuge for 30 seconds at 16000 rcf
17. Add 50 ul DNase/RNase-Free Water directly to column matrix
18. Incubate columns at room temp for 5 minutes
18. Centrifuge for 30 seconds at 16000 rcf
19. Remove columns and discard, keep final tubes with 100ul total elution on ice
19. Aliquot out 5 ul for QC (tape station and Qubit) and store in -80 for future use
20. Store eluted RNA and aliquiot (if not using immediately) in -80 freezer in a clearly labeled box
21. Clean up: Re-wipe down workstation

#### Notes
1. All tubes used should be RNase-free
2. Tubes used throughout the procedure do not require full labels, but final sample tubes should include sample ID, initials, and date
3. If you touch something other than the RNA bench while working, when you come back you must spray a little RNase-Zap on your gloves to prevent RNase contamination
