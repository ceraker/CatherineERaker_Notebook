## Prada Lab DNA Extractions
### Performed by: Cassie Raker
### Samples: *Orbicella faveolata* fragments from coral microbiome research in La Parguera, Puerto Rico
1. 2DW35
2. 2JQ7
3. 2HS48

### Date: September 3, 2020

## Kit: Machery-Nagel NucleoSpin Soil
Protocol adapted from the Machery-Nagel NucleoSpin Soil, and from a previous extractions performed on 8/27/20, 8/31/20, and 9/2/20.

#### DNA Lab Bench Prep
1. Wipe down workspace  with 10% bleach
2. Wipe down workspace  with Type II DI water
3. Wipe down workspace with 70% Ethanol
4. Workspace and equipment include: lab bench, tube racks being used, pipettes, vortexers, outside of centrifuges, outside of tissue lyser

#### Sample Prep
Whole tissue fragments preserved in seawater and stored in the -80 freezer

1. Remove samples from Prada lab shelf in -80 freezer
2. Thaw on ice: can take up to 1 hour
3. Fill three 1.5mL nuclease-free tubes with nuclease-free water (these are just for rinsing)
4. When ready: use forceps to rinse coral fragments in nuclease free water
5. IMPORTANT: use a good amount of coral tissue! At least the size of two peas.

#### Protocol
1. Transfer coral tissue to Bead Tube Type A: do not fill tube higher than 1mL!
2. Add 700 uL Lysis Buffer SL2 to Bead Tube
3. Be sure there is some air left at the top of the tube when closed
4. Put tubes in TissueLyser II (bead beater) and lock it
5. Run at 30 Hz for 5 minutes
6. Centrifuge at 11000 rcf for 2 minutes
7. Transfer ~600 uL of supernatant to new collection tube (not from kit)
8. Add 150 uL Buffer SL3
9. Vortex for 5 seconds
10. Incubate for 5 minutes at 4 C
11. Centrifuge at 11000 rcf for 1 minute
12. Place Inhibiter Removal Column (red ring) in a new Collection Tube
13. Transfer 700 uL of supernatant to Removal Column
14. Centrifuge at 11000 rcf for 1 minute
15. Discard Inhibitor Removal column
16. Add 250 uL Buffer SB
17. Vortex for 5 seconds
18. Place Spin Column (green ring) in a new Collection Tube
19. load 550 uL of sample onto Soil Column
20. Centrifuge at 11000 rcf for 1 minute
21. Discard flow through
22. Load remaining sample onto column
23. Centrifuge at 11000 rcf for 1 minute
24. (Start warming Elution Buffer to 80 C)
25. Discard flow through
26. Add 500 uL Buffer SB
27. Centrifuge at 11000 rcf for 30 seconds
28. Discard flow through
29. Add 550 uL Buffer SW1
30. Centrifuge at 11000 rcf for 30 seconds
31. Discard flow through
32. Add 650 uL Buffer SW2
33. Vortex for 2 seconds
34. Centrifuge at 11000 rcf for 30 seconds
35. Discard flow through
36. Add 650 uL Buffer SW2
37. Vortex for 2 seconds
38. Centrifuge at 11000 rcf for 30 seconds
39. Discard flow through
40. Centrifuge at 11000 rcf for 2 minutes
41. Place Spin Column in FINAL (i.e. fully labeled) tube
42. Add 100 uL warmed elution Buffer SE
43. DO NOT CLOSE LID
44. Incubate at room temperature for 1 minute
45. Close lid and centrifuge at 11000 rcf for 30 seconds
46. Discard Spin Column
47. Aliquot 10 ul from each sample for further Qubit analysis
48. Place finished extractions in labeled box on Prada lab shelf in -20
49. Clean-up: re-wipe down workstation


#### Notes
1. All tubes used should be nuclease-free
2. Tubes used throughout the procedure do not require full labels, but final sample tubes should include sample ID, initials, and date
3. Remember to close things right after you finish using them!
