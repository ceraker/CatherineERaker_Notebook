## Prada Lab DNA Quantifications (Qubit)
### Performed by: Cassie Raker and Maggie Schedl
### Samples: *Orbicella faveolata* fragments from coral microbiome research in La Parguera, Puerto Rico. Aliquots from previous extractions performed on 02/27/20.
1. 0GT50
2. 9IR3
3. 9JQ38

### Date: February 27, 2020

## Kit: Qubit DNA BR Assay Kit
Protocol adapted from the Life Technologies Qubit DNA BR Assay Kit and Maggie Schedl's previous experience

#### RNA Lab Bench Prep
1. Wipe down workspace  with 10% bleach
2. Wipe down workspace  with Type II DI water
3. Wipe down workspace with 70% Ethanol
4. Workspace includes: lab bench, tube racks being used, pipettes, vortexers, outside of centrifuges, outside of thermomixers

#### Preparing samples and standards
1. Remove 2 DNA standards from 4C fridge so they can adjust to room temperature
2. Remove aliquots from -80 freezer and put on ice (ice located in chest)
3. Remove one 2mL nuclease-free tube in which to prepare working solution
4. Calculate necessary uL of Quant-IT Reagent: 3 samples + 2 standards + 0.2 estimated error = 5.2 uL of Quant-IT Reagent
5. Calculate necessary uL of Qubit DNA BR Buffer from amount of reagent: 5.2 uL reagent x 199 = 1034.8 uL Qubit DNA BR Buffer
6. Add buffer and reagent to 2mL nuclease-free tube
7. Vortex mixture and spin down: this is the Qubit working solution
8. Label 5 nuclease-free tubes for Qubit analysis: 2 tubes for standards labeled S1 and S2, and 3 tubes for samples, labeled 2 and 6 (for 0GT50, 9IR3, and 9JQ38)
9. Add 190 uL of Qubit working solution to each standard tube (vortex and spin down if necessary)
10. Add 10 uL of each Qubit standard to the appropriate tubes
11. Add 199 uL of Qubit working solution to each sample tube
12. Flick to mix DNA in original aliquot tubes, then spin down
13. Add 1 uL DNA to sample tubes
14. Vortex all 5 tubes and spin down (use inserts in minifuge if necessary)

#### Reading standards and samples
1. On the Home screen of the QubitÂ® 2.0 Fluorometer, press **DNA**, then select **DNA Broad Range** as the assay type. The Standards screen is displayed.
2. On the Standards screen, press **Yes** to read the standards.
3. Insert the tube labeled S1 into the sample chamber, close the lid, then press **Read**. When the reading is complete (~3 seconds), remove S1. **Reading was: 51.04 rfu**
4. Insert the tube labeled S2 into the sample chamber, close the lid, then press **Read**. When the reading is complete (~3 seconds), remove S2. **Reading was: 17114**
5. Press **Run samples**
6. Insert sample tube labeled GT into the sample chamber, close the lid, then press **Read**. When the
reading is complete (~3 seconds), remove the sample tube. **Reading 1 for 0GT50 was: 40.6 ng/uL**
7. Insert sample tube labeled IR into the sample chamber, close the lid, then press **Read**. When the
reading is complete (~3 seconds), remove the sample tube. **Reading 1 for 9IR3 was: 24.0 ng/uL**
8. Insert sample tube labeled JQ into the sample chamber, close the lid, then press **Read**. When the
reading is complete (~3 seconds), remove the sample tube. **Reading 1 for 9JQ38 was: 31.4 ng/uL**
9. Repeat steps 6 and 7 to obtain second readings: **Reading 2 for 0GT50 was: 40.2 ng/uL. Reading 2 for 9IR3 was: 23.8 ng/uL. Reading 2 for 9JQ38 was 31.2 ng/ul.**

#### Clean-up
1. Replace aliquots in -80
2. Replace Qubit DNA BR Buffer and Qubit DNA BR Reagent in 4C fridge
3. Replace Qubit DNA Standards in labeled drawer
4. Discard used tubes with discarded pipette tips (all are safe to be disposed of in the trash)
5. Re-wipe down workspace
