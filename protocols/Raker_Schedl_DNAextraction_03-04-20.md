### Samples: *Orbicella faveolata* fragments from coral microbiome research in La Parguera, Puerto Rico
1. 0GT50
2. 9IR3
3. 9JQ38

### Date: March 4, 2020

## Kit: ZymoBIOMICS DNA Miniprep Kit
Protocol adapted from the ZymoBIOMICS DNA Miniprep Kit

#### RNA Lab Bench Prep
1. Wipe down workspace  with 10% bleach
2. Wipe down workspace  with Type II DI water
3. Wipe down workspace with 70% Ethanol
4. Workspace and equipment include: lab bench, tube racks being used, pipettes, vortexers, outside of centrifuges, outside of thermomixers

#### Sample Prep
Whole tissue fragments preserved in seawater and stored in the -80 freezer

1. Remove samples from Prada lab shelf in -80 freezer
2. Thaw on ice: takes around 1 hour
3. Fill two 1.5 mL nuclease-free tubes with nuclease-free water (these are just for rinsing)
4. When ready: use forceps to rinse coral fragments in nuclease free water

#### DNA Extraction and Elution
1. Start warming the ZymoBIOMICS DNase/RNase Free Water to 70C
2. Add prepared samples to ZR BashingBead Lysis Tubes
  1. Label these tubes on the top and the side, as top labels can rub off in the TissueLyser 
3. Add 750 ul ZymoBIOMICS Lysis Solution to each tube and cap tightly
4. Put tubes in TissueLyser II (bead beater) and lock it
5. Run at 30.0/s for 5 minutes
6. Centrifuge Lysis Tubes at 12000 rcf for 1 minute
7. Transfer 400 ul of the supernatant to the Zymo-Spin III-F Filter in a Collection Tube (these should come as a set)
8. Centrifuge at 8000 rcf for 1 minute
9. Discard III-F Filter
10. Add 1200 ul of ZymoBIOMICS DNA Binding Buffer to the filtrate generated after Step 9
  1. Add 200 ul first
  2. Add 1000 ul second
  3. Use the 1000 ul to mix by pumping the pipette up and down slowly ten times
11. Transfer 800 ul of mixture generated in step 10 to Zymo-Spin IICR Column in a Collection Tube (these should come as a set)
12. Centrifuge at 10000 rcf for 1 minute
13. Discard flow through
14. Transfer 800 ul of mixture generated in step 10 to IICR Column
15. Centrifuge at 10000 rcf for 1 minute
16. Discard flow through
17. Transfer IICR Column to a new Collection Tube
18. Add 400 ul ZymoBIOMICS DNA Wash Buffer 1 to IICR Column
19. Centrifuge at 10000 rcf for 1 minute
20. Discard flow through
21. Add 700 ul ZymoBIOMICS DNA Wash Buffer 2 to IICR Column
22. Centrifuge at 10000 rcf for 1 minute
23. Discard flow through
24. Add 200 ul ZymoBIOMICS DNA Wash Buffer 2 to IICR Column
25. Centrifuge at 10000 rcf for 1 minute
26. Transfer IICR Column to a clean 1.5 ml nuclease free tube
27. Add 50 ul warmed ZymoBIOMICS DNase/RNase Free WAter directly to column matrix
28. Incubate at room temperature for 5 minutes
29. Centrifuge at 10000 rcf for 1 minute
30. Add 50 ul warmed ZymoBIOMICS DNase/RNase Free WAter directly to column matrix
31. Incubate at room temperature for 5 minutes
32. Centrifuge at 10000 rcf for 1 minute
33. Prep Zymo-Spin III-HRC Filter
  1. Can work on this during incubation Steps 28 and 31
  2. Place Zymo-Spin III-HRC Filter in new Collection Tube (these should come as a set)
  3. Add 600 ul ZymoBIOMICS HRC Prep Solution
  4. Centrifuge at 8000 rcf for 3 minutes
  5. Discard flow through
  6. Move III-HRC Filter to final 1.5 ml nuclease free tubes
34. Transfer 100 ul eluted DNA from Step 32 to III-HRC Filter (now in final tubes)
35. Centrifuge at 16000 rcf for 3 minutes
36. Discard III-HRC Filter
37. Aliquot 10 ul from each sample for further Qubit analysis
38. Place finished extractions in labeled box on Prada lab shelf in -20
39. Clean-up: re-wipe down workstation

#### Notes
1. All tubes used should be nuclease-free
2. Tubes used throughout the procedure do not require full labels, but final sample tubes should include sample ID, initials, and date
3. Remember to close things right after you finish using them!
