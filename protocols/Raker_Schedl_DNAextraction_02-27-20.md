### Performed by: Cassie Raker and Maggie Schedl
### Samples: *Orbicella faveolata* fragments from coral microbiome research in La Parguera, Puerto Rico
1. 0GT50
2. 9IR3
3. 9JQ38

### Date: February 27, 2020

## Kit: Zymo *Quick*-DNA Miniprep Plus Test Kit
Protocol adapted from the Zymo *Quick*-DNA Miniprep Plus Test Kit

#### RNA Lab Bench Prep
1. Wipe down workspace  with 10% bleach
2. Wipe down workspace  with Type II DI water
3. Wipe down workspace with 70% Ethanol
4. Workspace and equipment include: lab bench, tube racks being used, pipettes, vortexers, outside of centrifuges, outside of thermomixers

#### Sample Prep
1. Remove samples from Prada lab shelf in -80 freezer
2. Thaw on ice: takes around 1 hour
3. Fill two 1.5mL nuclease-free tubes with nuclease-free water (these are just for rinsing)
4. When ready: use forceps to rinse coral fragments in nuclease free water

#### Reagent Prep
1. Remove Proteinase K Storage Buffer and Proteinase K from the Prada lab shelf in the -20
2. Add 1,040 ul of Proteinase K Storage Buffer to the lyophilized Proteinase K
3. Vortex and spin down: solution should be clear

#### Digestion (Start: 11:12am, End: 2:07pm)
1. Label one 1.5mL nuclease-free tube per sample for digestion
2. In each tube:
  1. Add 95 ul nuclease free water
  2. Add 95 ul Solid Tissue Buffer (blue)
  3. Add 10 ul mixed Proteinase K
3. Set ThermoMixer to 55 C
  1. Press Start and then Stop to start it warming up
  2. Set to 1000 rpm
4. Use forceps to place rinsed coral fragments in Digestion tubes
5. Place samples in ThermoMixer, and press Start
6. Check ThermoMixer every hour, spinning down to get rid of bubbles as needed
7. Digest for 3 hours
8. Centrifuge at 12000 rcf for 1 minute to remove solid material

#### DNA Extraction and Elution
1. Start warming DNA Elution Buffer to 70 C
  1. Volume = 100 ul per sample
2. Extract supernatant from top of samples and add to new labeled 1.5mL nuclease-free tubes
  1. ~230 ul from each sample
  2. Supernatant should appear yellow
3. Add 2 volumes of Genomic Binding Buffer to supernatant
  1. 460 ul
4. Vortex and spin down
5. Total volume for each sample: 690 ul
  1. Set pipette to 700 ul
  2. Cannot add more than 700 ul at once to spin columns
6. Transfer 700 ul (total volume) to labeled Zymo-Spin IIC-XLR Column in a Collection Tube
  1. 0GT50: 700 ul
  2. 9IR3: 700 ul
  3. 9JQ38: 750 ul
7. Centrifuge at 12000 rcf for 1 minute
8. Discard flow-through in a labeled hazardous waste container
  1. Reuse Collection Tube
9. Add 400 ul DNA Pre-Wash Buffer to spin column
10. Centrifuge at 12000 rcf for 1 minute
11. Discard flow-through in hazardous waste
12. Add 700 ul g-DNA Wash Buffer to spin column
13. Centrifuge at 12000 rcf for 1 minute
14. Discard flow-through in hazardous waste
15. Add 400 ul g-DNA Wash Buffer to spin column
16. Centrifuge at 12000 rcf for 1 minute
17. Discard flow through in hazardous waste
18. Transfer spin column to final labeled 1.5 mL nuclease-free tube
19. Add 50 ul warmed DNA Elution Buffer directly on the matrix
20. Incubate at room temperature for 5 minutes
21. Centrifuge at max speed for 1 minute
22. Add 50 ul warmed DNA Elution Buffer directly on the matrix
23. Incubate at room temperature for 5 minutes
24. Centrifuge at max speed for 1 minute
25. Discard spin column
26. Aliquot 10 ul from each sample for further Qubit analysis
27. Place finished extractions in labeled box on Prada lab shelf in -20
28. Clean-up: re-wipe down workstation

#### Notes
1. All tubes used should be nuclease-free
2. Tubes used throughout the procedure do not require full labels, but final sample tubes should include sample ID, initials, and date
3. Remember to close things right after you finish using them!
