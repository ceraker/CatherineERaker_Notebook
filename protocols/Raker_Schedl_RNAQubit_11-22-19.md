## Prada Lab RNA Quantifications (Qubit)
### Performed by: Cassie Raker and Maggie Schedl
### Samples: *Orbicella faveolata* fragments from the first round of coral microbiome research in La Parguera, Puerto Rico. Aliquots from previous extractions performed on 11/15/19.
1. 2BY9
2. 6BY20

### Date: November 22, 2019

## Kit: Qubit RNA BR Assay Kit
Protocol adapted from the Life Technologies Qubit RNA BR Assay Kit and Maggie Schedl's previous experience

#### RNA Lab Bench Prep
1. Wipe down workspace  with 10% bleach
2. Wipe down workspace  with Type II DI water
3. Wipe down workspace with 70% Ethanol
4. Wipe down workspace and equipment with RNase Zap: lab bench, tube racks being used, pipettes, vortexers, outside of centrifuges, outside of thermomixers

#### Preparing samples and standards
1. Remove 2 RNA standards from 4C fridge so they can adjust to room temperature
2. Remove aliquots from -80 freezer and put on ice (ice located in chest)
3. Remove one 2mL nuclease-free tube in which to prepare working solution
4. Calculate necessary uL of Qubit RNA BR Reagent: 2 samples + 2 standards + 0.2 estimated error = 4.2 uL of Qubit RNA BR Reagent
5. Calculate necessary uL of Qubit RNA BR Buffer from amount of reagent: 4.2 uL reagent x 199 = 835.8 uL Qubit RNA BR Buffer
6. Add buffer and reagent to 2mL nuclease-free tube
7. Vortex mixture and spin down: this is the Qubit working solution
8. Label 4 nuclease-free tubes for Qubit analysis: 2 tubes for standards labeled S1 and S2, and 2 tubes for samples, labeled 2 and 6 (for 2BY9 and 6BY20)
9. Add 190 uL of Qubit working solution to each standard tube
10. Add 10 uL of each Qubit standard to the appropriate tubes
11. Add 199 uL of Qubit working solution to each sample tube
12. Flick to mix RNA in original aliquot tubes, then spin down
13. Add 1 uL RNA to sample tubes
14. Vortex all 4 tubes and spin down

#### Reading standards and samples
1. On the Home screen of the QubitÂ® 2.0 Fluorometer, press **RNA**, then select **RNA Broad Range** as the assay type. The Standards screen is displayed.
2. On the Standards screen, press **Yes** to read the standards.
3. Insert the tube labeled S1 into the sample chamber, close the lid, then press **Read**. When the reading is complete (~3 seconds), remove S1. **Reading was: 340.11 rfu**
4. Insert the tube labeled S2 into the sample chamber, close the lid, then press **Read**. When the reading is complete (~3 seconds), remove S2. **Reading was: 10409.7**
5. Press **Run samples**
6. Insert sample tube labeled 2 into the sample chamber, close the lid, then press **Read**. When the
reading is complete (~3 seconds), remove the sample tube. **Reading 1 for 2BY9 was: 135 ng/uL**
7. Insert sample tube labeled 6 into the sample chamber, close the lid, then press **Read**. When the
reading is complete (~3 seconds), remove the sample tube. **Reading 1 for 6BY20 was: 71.8 ng/uL**
8. Repeat steps 6 and 7 to obtain second readings: **Reading 2 for 2BY9 was: 136 ng/uL. Reading 2 for 6BY20 was: 71.8 ng/uL.**

#### Clean-up
1. Replace aliquots in -80
2. Replace Qubit RNA BR Buffer and Qubit RNA BR Reagent in 4C fridge
3. Replace Qubit RNA Standards in labeled drawer
4. Discard used tubes with discarded pipette tips
5. Re-wipe down workspace
